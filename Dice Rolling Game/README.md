# 🎲 Dice Rolling Game

A simple Python project that simulates rolling one or more dice. Each time the user presses **Enter**, the program rolls the dice and shows random values between 1 and 6 using Python’s `random` module.

This project is part of the **Python Mini Projects** collection to practice Python basics like loops, functions, and modules such as `random`.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed on your system. You can download it from:

```bash
https://www.python.org/downloads

## ▶️ How to Use

  - Open a terminal in the Dice Rolling Game folder
  - Run: python dice_rolling_game.py
  - Follow the on-screen instructions

## 🛠️ How It Works

The game uses Python’s built-in random module to simulate the roll of one or more six-sided dice. Each roll produces a different number from 1 to 6 (inclusive).

## 💡 Learning Goals

  By completing this project, you’ll practice:

    - Basic Python syntax

    - Using Python modules (random)

    - Taking user input

    - Loop control for repeated rolls
