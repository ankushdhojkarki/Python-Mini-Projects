💰 Expense Tracker – From Terminal App to Web Application

This is my personal project where I’m building an Expense Tracker step by step.
I’m starting with a basic terminal-based version in Python, and my long-term goal is to evolve this into a fully functional web app using Django (and eventually deploy it for real-world use).

This project is not just about the final product — it’s about the journey of learning and building.

Add features step by step (logging, categorizing, summaries, etc.)

Transition into a Django-powered web application

Deploy it so it can be accessed online as a real tool
