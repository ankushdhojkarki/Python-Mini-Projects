# 💰 Expense Tracker – A Python Program to Manage Expenses

This is my personal project where I’m building an Expense Tracker step by step.
I’m starting with a basic terminal-based version in Python, and my long-term goal is to evolve this into a fully functional web app using Django (and eventually deploy it for real-world use).

This project is not just about the final product — it’s about the journey of learning and building.

## 🏗️ project Vision
- Start with a Python terminal-based expense tracker

- Add features step by step (logging, categorizing, summaries, etc.)

- Transition into a Django-powered web application

- Deploy it so it can be accessed online as a real tool

## 📌 How It Works

- Prompts the user with a menu of options:
  - Add a new expense (with description and amount).
  - View all recorded expenses.
  - Calculate the total amount spent.
  - Exit the program.
- Stores expenses in memory during the session.
- Displays expenses in a clean and readable format.

⬜ Deploy fully functional app online

## 🌱 Why This Project?
This is more than a mini-project — it’s my learning journey.
By starting simple and improving step by step, I’m learning how to take an idea from scratch and grow it into something meaningful and useful.
