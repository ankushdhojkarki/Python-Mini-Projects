🎯 Password Generator  
A simple, interactive terminal-based program that generates strong, random passwords based on the user's preferences.

📌 How It Works  
- Prompts the user to choose whether to include:  
  • Letters (uppercase and lowercase)  
  • Numbers  
  • Symbols (e.g., !@#$%&*)  
- Makes sure the user selects at least one character type.  
- Asks for the desired password length and validates the input.  
- Generates a random password using the selected criteria.  
- Displays the password.  
- Asks the user if they want to generate another one.  
- Handles invalid input using a `try-except` block.

📁 Files Included  
- `mainr.py` — Main Python script for the password generator.
