🎯 Password Generator  
A simple, interactive terminal program that helps users create strong, random passwords based on their preferences.

📌 How It Works  
- The program asks the user which types of characters to include in the password:  
  - Letters (uppercase and lowercase)  
  - Numbers  
  - Symbols (e.g., !, @, #, etc.)  
- It ensures the user selects at least one character type to avoid an empty password.  
- The user is prompted to enter the desired length of the password (must be a positive number).  
- A random password is generated using the selected character types.  
- The generated password is displayed to the user.  
- Users can choose to generate more passwords or exit the program.  
- Invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values or negative numbers) are handled gracefully with clear error messages.
