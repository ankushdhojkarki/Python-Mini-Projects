🎯 Password Generator  
    A simple, interactive terminal-based program that generates strong, random passwords based on the user's preferences.

📌 How It Works  
- Prompts the user to choose whether to include:
  - Letters (both uppercase and lowercase)
  - Numbers
  - Symbols (like !@#$%&*)
- Ensures the user selects at least one character type.
- Asks for the desired password length and validates the input.
- Generates a random password of that length using the selected character types.
- Displays the generated password.
- Offers the option to generate another password or exit.
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully using a `try-except` block.

📁 Files Included  
- `main.py` — Main script that runs the password generator.

▶️ How to Run  
1. Open your terminal and navigate to the folder where the script is saved, then run:

    ```bash
    python main.py

2. Follow the prompts to generate your custom password.
