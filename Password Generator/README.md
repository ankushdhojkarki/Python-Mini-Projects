🎯 Password Generator  
A simple, interactive terminal program that helps users create strong, random passwords based on their preferences.

📌 How It Works  
- The program asks the user which types of characters to include in the password: letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and symbols.  
- It ensures the user selects at least one character type to avoid an empty password.  
- The user is prompted to enter the desired length of the password (must be a positive number).  
- The program generates a random password of the specified length using the selected character types.  
- The generated password is displayed to the user.  
- Users can choose to generate more passwords or exit the program.  
- Invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric length) are handled gracefully with error messages, prompting the user to try again.
